            <div class="attractive-description">
                <p>The backend is the brain of the application. It handles the data, security, and business logic that makes everything else possible.</p>
                <h2>I. Database Architecture</h2>
                <p>We utilize relational databases (PostgreSQL) for structured data and NoSQL (Redis) for high-speed caching. This dual-layer approach ensures that data remains consistent and durable while also being available in milliseconds. We focus on normalized schemas that prevent data redundancy and ensure fast query execution.</p>
                <h2>II. API Security</h2>
                <p>Every piece of data that leaves our server is protected. We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and implement strict rate-limiting to protect against DDoS attacks. By following the "Principle of Least Privilege," we ensure that each service only has access to the data it absolutely needs, minimizing the impact of any potential breach.</p>
