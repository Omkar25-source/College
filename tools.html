                <p>The bridge between a designer's vision and a developer's code is built through advanced tooling. This page highlights our systematic approach to UI/UX design and the software that makes it possible.</p>
                <h2>I. Figma & Prototyping</h2>
                <p>We use Figma not just for drawing, but for building living design systems. Through the use of "Design Tokens"—variables for colors, spacing, and typography—we ensure that our design files and our code stay in perfect sync. This "Single Source of Truth" reduces errors and speeds up the development cycle by 40%.</p>
                <h2>II. Handoff and Documentation</h2>
                <p>Using tools like Storybook, we document every UI component in isolation. This allows developers to see every state of a button or input field without running the full application. This rigorous documentation ensures that the brand identity remains consistent across every page and every feature we build.</p>
