                <p>Mobile devices are the primary way users interact with the web. This page covers the logic behind building high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications.</p>
                <h2>I. Responsive vs. Adaptive</h2>
                <p>We don't just shrink a website; we adapt the experience. This means rethinking navigation for the thumb, optimizing image assets for mobile data speeds, and ensuring that touch targets are large and accessible. Our "Mobile-First" approach ensures that the smallest screen provides the greatest impact.</p>
                <h2>II. Performance on the Go</h2>
                <p>Battery life and data usage are critical considerations. We optimize our JavaScript to be "lightweight," preventing excessive CPU usage that drains batteries. By implementing offline-first capabilities, we ensure that the user can still access key features even when they lose their internet connection.</p>
