                <p>DevOps is the culture of automation. This project details our journey into the cloud, focusing on the stability, security, and scalability of modern software environments.</p>
                <h2>I. Containerization (Docker)</h2>
                <p>By using Docker, we package our applications into immutable containers. This ensures that the code that works on a developer's machine works exactly the same in production. We manage these containers using Kubernetes, which handles the orchestration, scaling, and self-healing of our services automatically.</p>
                <h2>II. CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
                <p>Our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline ensures that every line of code is automatically tested and scanned for security vulnerabilities. This automated approach allows us to deploy updates multiple times a day with the confidence that the system remains stable and secure for the end-user.</p>
